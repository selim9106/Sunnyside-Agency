# Sunnyside Agency
Sunnyside Agency is a common front-end responsive project that many developers worked on.
I did it during my Junior Developer Bootcamp at [Becode.org](https://github.com/becodeorg).

Though you can find many tuts to help, I chosed to use the knowledges I developed during this training.

# Goals

The point is to manipulate semantic HTML5 and *pure CSS* (with [**BEM**](https://getbem.com/) & **SCSS** syntax compiled with [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/) tool) to create a responsive landing page.   
I added a little script (Vanilla JS) to handle the *toggling* mobile burger menu.
